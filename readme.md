# Interactive 3D and 2D Shapes with Processing

This program is an interactive visualization created using Processing, combining both 2D and 3D elements. It allows users to manipulate shapes, rotate objects, and apply transformations like scaling and mirroring. The project consists of two main parts: a 2D shape consisting of custom polygons and a 3D rendering of letters with adjustable angles and thickness.

## Features
- **2D Shape Manipulation**: Interactive control over a custom 2D shape that can be rotated, scaled, and mirrored along both X and Y axes.
- **3D Text Animation**: Displays the letters "R" and "V" in 3D space, with the ability to control the rotation along X, Y, and Z axes.
- **Real-time Interaction**: Users can control the movement, scaling, and rotation using keyboard inputs.

## Controls
- **2D Shape Controls:**
  - `W`: Rotate clockwise.
  - `C`: Rotate counter-clockwise.
  - `<`: Mirror the shape along the X-axis.
  - `>`: Mirror the shape along the Y-axis.
  - `+`: Increase the scale of the shape.
  - `-`: Decrease the scale of the shape.
  - **Arrow Keys**: Move the shape up, down, left, or right.

- **3D Text Controls:**
  - `W`: Rotate 3D object up (Pitch).
  - `S`: Rotate 3D object down (Pitch).
  - `A`: Rotate 3D object left (Yaw).
  - `D`: Rotate 3D object right (Yaw).
  - `Q`: Rotate 3D object left (Roll).
  - `E`: Rotate 3D object right (Roll).

## Technologies Used
- **Processing**: A flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts.
- **PShape**: Used to create custom 2D shapes for the "R" and "I" characters.
- **PFont**: Used to render 3D text with adjustable thickness.

## Setup Instructions
1. Download and install [Processing IDE](https://processing.org/download/).
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the `.pde` file in Processing IDE.
4. Run the sketch to start the interactive program.
